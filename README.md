# MobileInputModule
The Mobile Input Module was part of my final thesis at the S4G School for Games GmbH and is a practical approach on an adaptation of Unityâ€™s input system for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets which is easy to use and extend. It will save the time of implementing the query of different mobile inputs such as swipes, tilts, or pinches. The features of the plugin can be used through code or editor events and adjusted inside a custom settings menu. Due to the usage of scriptable objects as input triggers, you can extend the plugin to your liking by creating your own input triggers. The package was tested and worked on Unity 2018.3, 2019.1 and 2019.2.
